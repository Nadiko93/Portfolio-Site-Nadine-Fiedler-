                    <h3>The Background</h3>
                    <p>As a passionate language learner myself, I've encountered numerous challenges and setbacks on my language journey 
                        and I understand firsthand how daunting it can be to transition to native materials. 
                        When learners begin to gain confidence with their study materials, 
                        delving into books aimed at native speakers can feel intimidating and it often shows them how much there is still to learn. 
                        This often leads to negative emotions such as overwhelm and insecurity. 
                        To prevent these feelings, it's essential to help learners ease into native reading materials 
                        and seamlessly merge language learning with the joy of reading.</p>

                        <h3>Problems</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Switching between the book and an external dictionary can disrupt the reading flow.</li>
                            <li>Evaluating a book's difficulty solely based on its cover or summary can lead to a frustrating experience 
                                when the level doesn't align with the learner's current language skills.</li>
                            <li>While reading is an effective way to passively grow your vocabulary, 
                                translating this into an active learning experience can be daunting and tiring, 
                                often diminishing the enjoyment of reading.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement a built-in dictionary to look up words directly while reading.</li>
                            <li>Display the difficulty level for each book so that learners can better evaluate if the book matches their skill level.</li>
                            <li>Offer a built-in learning opportunity that uses sentences from the books users have read, enabling users to learn in context.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Asking the right questions</h3>
                    <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the design requirements, I started by defining the 5WH questions. 
                        These questions helped me initially identify my target audience and the key functionalities 
                        that should be implemented in the app.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Who is the user?</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Intermediate and advanced language learners</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>What kind of tasks and goals will user achieve?</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users will improve their language skills through immersive reading of authentic content.</li>
                                <li>Users will actively practice newly acquired words.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>How will the users achieve their goals?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users can access e-books matching their language proficiency and interests.</li>
                            <li>Users can look up and save word meanings while reading.</li>
                            <li>Users can practice new vocabulary with exercises or flashcards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                <h3>Understanding the user flow</h3>
                <p>Utilizing the functionalities defined during the 5WH questions, 
                    I created 4 different user flows representing the necessary steps for users to achieve their goals. 
                    In addition to the onboarding process, I outlined user flows for the book search, word saving during reading, 
                    and vocabulary flashcards.</p>
                <p>I then translated these user flows into low-fidelity wireframes, 
                    highlighting essential elements to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience throughout the app.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Onboarding Flow</h3>
                    <p>For a quick and easy onboarding the users can sign up with their social media accounts, 
                        select the language they want to learn and easily start to read their first book.</p>

                        <p>The wireframes I initially created, based on the user flows, were minimal, 
                            focusing solely on essential flows and functionalities. 
                            Through further iterations, I refined the screen layouts and developed a visual style for the app. 
                            Given that the app aims to create an immersive environment for language learners to focus on improving 
                            their skills, the visual design is intentionally minimal and unobtrusive, 
                            allowing users to concentrate on their reading content without distractions.</p>

                            <p>With my high-fidelity wireframes, I created prototypes to test with users and collect their feedback for further improvements. 
                                The user tests revealed that users had difficulties understanding the flashcards correctly. 
                                They were unsure how to input, receive feedback, or evaluate their answers using the colored buttons. 
                                Since this presented a significant usability issue that could result in a poor user experience, 
                                I iterated on ideas to better inform the user about what was happening.</p>

                        <p>Users can look up the meaning of words directly while reading without the need to rely on an external 
                            dictionary. They also can save words for later reference and add them to different flashcard sets.</p>

                        <h3>Practice new words with SRS based Flashcards</h3>
                        <p>Lingoshelf utilizes spaced repetition to offer an effective method for actively practicing saved words, 
                            in addition to the more passive and immersive reading approach. 
                            Flashcards display words in sentences that users have encountered during their readings to provide 
                            context and enhance memorization.</p>

                    <h3>Be aware of your own biases</h3>
                    <p>Being a part of the product's target audience yourself can provide an advantage as it allows you to 
                        empathize better with the user's perspective. 
                        However, it can also be a disadvantage as it may make you more susceptible to biases based on your own preferences. 
                        Therefore, it is crucial to remain aware of these biases and be willing to set aside personal preferences 
                        when user research and testing reveal different needs and preferences.</p>
                    <h3>Consider users who may not appear to be your target audience at first glance</h3>
                    <p>To avoid designing in isolation and excluding individuals who may have less experience with language learning, 
                        it is essential to involve people from diverse backgrounds in both the research and design phases. 
                        This approach yields valuable insights and prevents the pitfall of designing exclusively for one specific group.</p>
